Mock Data Processing for Platanthera project
- _A. thaliana_ reads to be stripped from mock
- _P. zijinensis_ reads to be generated _in silico_ using **NGSNGS** 
- Dilute mock data with _P. zijinensis_ reads to benchmark metagenomics analysis based on host-contamination.
  - Dilute to 0, 50, and 95% host-contamination (maybe 80% also)
